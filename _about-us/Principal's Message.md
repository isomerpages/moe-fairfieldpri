<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>As we bid farewell to 2024 and welcome 2025, I hope this letter finds
you refreshed after an enjoyable year-end break with your children.
<br>
<br>Reflecting on my first year at FMS(P), I'm filled with gratitude for the
warm welcome and support from our wonderful community. Your unwavering
support and understanding have made the teachers’ work even more meaningful
and learning experiences for your children even more enriching.</p>
<p>2024 has been an exceptional year for FMS(P)! Our Primary 6 cohort achieved
outstanding PSLE results, with 99.6% of students advancing to secondary
education. The mean PSLE score for students taking 4 standard subjects
is 15.2, and 16.3 for all students. We heartily congratulate the 2024 Primary
6 cohort and wish them the very best in their next educational chapter.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, our focus on 'Laying Strong Foundations' (Luke 6:47-48)
has yielded remarkable results in character development and co-curricular
achievements. Our Fairsians have performed beyond our expectations; they
have demonstrated perseverance, resilience and teamwork, and achieved outstanding
outcomes. The following are just a few examples of our students’ achievements,
with some being a first for us.</p>
<p>During the inaugural Sophia Blackmore: Our Acts of Kindness (OAKS) programme,
our students contributed to, packed and presented care packs to our non-teaching
staff, recognising their contributions to the school. Student empowerment
reached new heights with our students exercising ownership and voting,
for the very first time, for student leaders to represent them in the Prefectorial
EXCO elections. During the new Fairfield Townhall initiative, Fairsians
expressed their views and made decisions over matters such as school cleanliness.
Our Peer Supporters programme flourished, and for the first time, a group
of them won first prize in a national Cyber Wellness poster competition.</p>
<p>In co-curricular activities (CCAs), Fairsians excelled across the board.
Highlights include the Volleyball Senior Girls' 3rd place in the Nationals,
the Concert Band's historic Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival,
and outstanding performances from our performing arts and uniformed groups.
The Boys' Brigade earned the Lim Siong Guan Challenge Trophy and James
Milner Fraser Award, while the Girls' Brigade and Red Cross unit secured
silver and gold awards respectively.</p>
<p>Our students have done well, and the teachers have been instrumental in
guiding them through a vibrant and holistic school life. Our staff’s commitment
has been recognised through various accolades, including teachers winning
the Caring Teacher Award (national and school level), our teaching and
non-teaching staff achieving the 2024 MOE Service Excellence Award and
MOE Innergy Award, recognising their outstanding service and creativity
in pedagogy and work solutions. Our staff have role modelled lifelong learning
and striving for excellence.</p>
<p>We thank God for His protection and faithfulness to FMS(P), enabling us
to perform well in 2024. We look forward to 2025, with anticipation and
hope. The school theme for 2025 is ‘Love is in the sunshine’, taken from
our school song and the theme verse is 1 John 4:19 “We love because He
first loved us.”. This phrase ‘Love is in the sunshine’ is inspiring and
hopeful, very apt for a time when the world is full of trouble and uncertainty.
In alignment with the theme, we want to continue to strengthen a school
culture that is loving and caring so that every student finds the school
a safe and happy place to learn and play in and every staff member feels
cared for and supported in their work. We also want to nurture every student
to do their part in loving and caring for others and the environment. This
theme also reminds us we can look forward to another good year because
we are confident of God’s love and He will continue to protect, guide and
bless FMS(P).</p>
<p>Before I end off, I would like to share staff movement for 2025. For staff
who are leaving FMS(P), we want to express our heartfelt thanks for their
many contributions to the school and wish them all the best in their future
endeavours. For new officers who are joining us, we extend a warm welcome
to our Fairfield community, and we look forward to working with them.</p>
