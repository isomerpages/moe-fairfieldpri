<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p><strong>‘Strong and Courageous’ for 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>As we welcome the new year, I am delighted to share with you our theme
for 2026: ‘Strong and Courageous’ drawn from 2 Timothy 1:7 ‘For God gave
us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.’ This theme
builds naturally upon our theme for 2025, ‘Love is in the Sunshine’, which
focused on God's love and protection, and our students exercising their
love for parents, siblings, teachers and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Why ‘Strong and Courageous’ for 2026?</strong>
</p>
<p>Building on the foundation of knowing God's love, the theme of ‘Strong
and Courageous’ now calls our students to step forward with confidence
and courage. In today's complex world, our students face numerous challenges
as they navigate their learning journey, build relationships and develop
their character. However, God has not given us a spirit of fear. Instead,
He has given us power, love and self-control. This means our students can
face any challenges with courage.</p>
<p><strong>What does ‘Strong and Courageous’ look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>When our students face a difficult test or struggle to understand a new
topic, they can be strong and courageous. They do not need to fear because
they are empowered and can take ownership to keep trying and to overcome
challenges. With this courage, they can stay hopeful and positive even
when learning feels hard.</p>
<p>As our students meet new classmates or teachers, they can be strong and
courageous in choosing to love others. This means having the courage to
get to know people who might be different from them. It means being empathetic
towards them so that they will continue to learn from others' views and
perspectives. When it is not always easy to be kind and understanding,
they can still choose to do so. When our students do that, they help build
a caring and loving school where everyone feels welcome.</p>
<p>With lessons in school and parents’ loving support at home, our students
can be strong and courageous to be more discerning in their choice of words
and actions. God has given them self-control, which means they can exercise
self-discipline and take charge of their own learning. They can choose
to work hard, play well and help others. They can be wise about how they
spend their time and careful about how they treat people.</p>

they need. Together, we can help them grow into young people who enjoy
learning, have confidence, and are hopeful about the future.</p>
