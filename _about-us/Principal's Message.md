<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
As we embark on the final term of the year, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your unwavering support throughout Term 3.
 
The past term was filled with numerous achievements, which could not have been possible without your support. ‘Fairfield! The Musical’ was a resounding success, brimming with talent and creativity from both our students and dedicated staff. Your presence and encouragement in the audience were deeply felt by everyone involved, and we hope that you, too, were touched by the moving Fairfield story that spanned the founding of to the current Fairfield that we know and love. As we commemorated our 135th Founder's Day, we were reminded to be thankful for God’s favour, faithfulness and blessings in our school’s journey of growth and development.

This year, we are also proud to share that our HOD/ICT, Ms Chen Siyun, has been awarded the pinnacle award for educators, the President’s Award for Teachers (PAT). She is our second PAT recipient, with the first being awarded in 2019 to Mr Joel Lim, Lead Teacher (Mathematics). Truly, we are proud to have teachers who constantly innovate and hone their teaching and learning skills and processes to better engage students. We are glad to have a team of committed and excellent teachers at Fairfield, who nurture and support our students’ needs in all that they do. As we celebrate Teachers’ Day, we are thankful for the support of our stakeholders, like our parents, who affirm the work of our teachers with words of encouragement and constant prayers.

As we forge ahead, I encourage you to continue supporting your child in school activities, engaging with your child's progress, and maintaining open lines of communication with our teachers. Your insights and feedback are invaluable to us as we seek to improve our teaching practices and processes.

Let's embrace Term 4 with enthusiasm and anticipation, knowing that our combined efforts will lead to even greater achievements and growth for our students. Thank you once again for being an integral part of our Fairfield family. Here's to an enriching Term 4, marked by God’s goodness and mercy!

To God be the Glory!

In partnership with you,  <br>
