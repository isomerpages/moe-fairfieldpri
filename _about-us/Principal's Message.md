<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>As we conclude an eventful Term 1, it marks a time of reflection and thanksgiving
for how God has safely guided our school through the term. I would like
to share some activities that have enriched our students’ school experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started Term 1 with our inaugural <strong>Start It Right!</strong> programme
which ensured a smooth transition for our students across levels, building
relationships among teachers and students in their form classes. This initiative
dovetails nicely with our theme of the year, ‘<strong>Laying Strong Foundations</strong>’
(Luke 6:47-48). During the term, we witnessed several events that exemplified
Fairsian outcomes and Fairfield spirit, allowing students to embrace diversity
by fostering strong connections and supporting one another through various
activities. The <strong>Chinese New Year celebrations</strong> united our
diverse student community as we celebrated the richness of traditions through
student and teacher performances. To commemorate <strong>Total Defence Day, </strong>our
students actively participated in water rationing. They demonstrated resilience
and reflected on their collective role in the broader community and nation.
Additionally, the <strong>Primary 5 Camp</strong> held at Sentosa was a fantastic
adventure, fostering friendships, teamwork and character development among
our students, who courageously stepped out of their comfort zones. I would
like to thank the staff who have worked hard to plan and organise these
enriching learning experiences for our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the warm welcome
I received at the <strong>Meet-the-Parents</strong> sessions held in January.
Your engagement and unwavering support during the sessions and throughout
the term are critical for your child’s learning journey in school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we eagerly await Term 2, may God continue to grant our students and
staff the wisdom and strength to embrace another term filled with exciting
and meaningful learning opportunities!</p>
<p>Serving with you,
<br><strong>Mrs Soh Mei Foong</strong>
<br>Principal</p>
