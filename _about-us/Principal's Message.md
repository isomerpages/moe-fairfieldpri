<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>As we conclude another successful term, I am filled with immense gratitude
and pride. Our school has accomplished so much over the past few months,
and it is all thanks to the unwavering support and dedication from each
of our students, staff and of course, you.</p>
<p>Together, we have seen our students enjoy school, thrive in their learning,
and excel in extracurricular activities. The array of programmes and activities,
many of which are included below as a throwback to the term, has contributed
in helping our students achieve the Fairsian Outcomes of Mastering Self,
Relating Well with Others, and Serving God and the Community. Your active
participation in our programmes and activities, from volunteering at events
to supporting your children's learning at home, has been invaluable. It
truly takes a village to raise a child.</p>
<p>As we look forward to the new term, I am excited about the learning experiences
that lie ahead for our students. Our teachers have planned exciting programmes
and activities that will continue to enhance our students' learning and
foster their development.</p>
<p>During this semester, the Primary 6 students will also be busy preparing
for the PSLE. We will work together with you to walk this journey with
our students to give them the necessary support and encouragement so that
each of our students will perform their best at the national examination.</p>
<p>You are an integral part of our school community and we thank you for
your involvement and strong support.</p>
<p>Serving with you,
<br><strong>Mrs Soh Mei Foong</strong>
<br>Principal</p>
<p></p>
