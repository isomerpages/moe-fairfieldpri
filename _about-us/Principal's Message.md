<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>As I reflect on Term 1, I am thankful to God for His blessings and protection
over our Fairfield community. It was a busy and exciting term, and our
teachers have worked tirelessly to plan and organise meaningful activities,
from daily lessons in class, festive celebrations to the commemoration
of national events, enriching our students' school experience.</p>
<p>I am particularly grateful for our PiEs’ (Partners in Education) unwavering
support. Beyond helping with regular school events, many of you have stepped
forward to support our teachers in the inaugural structured programme to
teach our Primary 1 students touch-typing. On the last day of Term 1, the
tremendous turnout of PiEs at our Primary 4 and 6 Sports Carnival was also
heartening to see.</p>
<p>Moving into Term 2, in addition to academic learning, our teachers have
planned various enrichment experiences and learning journeys to develop
our students' character and 21st century competencies. I understand some
parents may be concerned about academic progress especially for the upper
primary students, since there will not be a mid-year structured pen-paper
examination. Please be assured that teachers are continuously assessing
students' learning through daily lessons and assignments, allowing us to
track progress and provide timely support where needed. Therefore, the
continuous assessment for learning is more meaningful and helpful for our
students’ learning.</p>
<p>Education goes beyond academic achievement - it is fundamentally about
nurturing good character. This year, our school is placing special emphasis
on the values of ‘respect’ and ‘empathy’. We seek your partnership in reinforcing
these values to your children. This includes teaching them to respect family
members, teachers, and friends, as well as following school rules such
as wearing their uniform smartly and keeping our environment clean. In
public spaces, they should demonstrate consideration for others by speaking
at appropriate volumes and showing courteous behavior. When our students
embody respect and empathy, they naturally develop better relationships
with their peers, reducing unnecessary conflicts. Your support in this
endeavor is crucial as we work together to nurture a generation of happy,
confident, and kind individuals.</p>
<p>I would like to share that one of our Vice-Principals, Mr Ho, will be
leaving the school for a leadership development programme, after which
he will be posted to another school. On behalf of the Fairfield community,
I thank Mr Ho for his dedicated service and commitment to the school as
a member of our school leadership team. We wish him all the best in his
future endeavours. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome
Mr Roy Cheng, a Physical Education teacher, who joined our teaching staff
at the end of last term.</p>
<p>As we embark on a new term, thank you for your continued support of our
school's mission to provide holistic education. Together, we can make a
positive difference in your child's development.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,
<br>Mrs Soh Mei Foong
<br>Principal</p>
