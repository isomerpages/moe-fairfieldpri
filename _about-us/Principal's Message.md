<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>As we bid farewell to Term 3 and embark on the fourth quarter of 2024,
we are filled with gratitude for the journey thus far. Time has indeed
flown by, and as we reflect on the past term, the word "gratefulness" resonates
deeply within us.</p>
<p>While Term 3 was packed with activities and programmes, it was also a
time of celebration and reflection. We commemorated Racial Harmony Day
and celebrated National Day, which served as poignant reminders of the
peace and harmony we are privileged to experience as Singaporeans. We are
also reminded of our roles in nurturing our young ones to continue to actively
contribute to build on the prosperity and harmony of our nation.</p>
<p>Founder’s Day was another significant occasion for the Fairfield community,
for us to express gratitude to Miss Sophia Blackmore and the many individuals
who have contributed to the rich tapestry of Fairfield Methodist School
(Primary). This year’s Founder’s Day was especially significant for us
as our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department and Student
Leadership (SL) Committee collaborated to launch the “Our Acts of Kindness
(OAKS)” Programme. This initiative aligns with our Fairsian Outcomes (FO)
and will be a yearly platform for our students to serve the community,
exemplifying the value of "Serving God and the Community". For this year’s
inaugural OAKS, our students contributed items of necessities and packed
them into Care Packs. The students presented the Care Packs to our support
staff, who are the unsung heroes whose service is important for the school
to function daily.</p>
<p>The term culminated in the celebration of Teachers’ Day, a time to honour
and appreciate our dedicated educators. Our teachers’ unwavering commitment
to the holistic development of our students is truly commendable, and we
are grateful for their selfless dedication.</p>
<p>Term 3 has been a whirlwind of activities, and we are thankful for God’s
protection and blessings. Our staff have managed to carry out all the programmes
that they have planned for and brought the students through many exciting
and meaningful learning experiences both in school and learning journeys
outside school.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt appreciation to all parents and guardians, as
well as our esteemed Partners in Education (PiEs), for your steadfast support
and understanding. We are deeply moved by the contributions and unwavering
support shown by our PiEs, who have tirelessly assisted our teachers in
many of our programmes. Thank you, PiEs, for setting up a one-day alfresco
dining experience for our teachers, preparing breakfast for them to celebrate
Teachers’ Day. Our teachers are very touched by your generosity and love.</p>
<p>As we approach the final term of the year, we recognise that it will be
a period of consolidation of learning and assessments for our students.
While this may bring about some stress and anxiety, the school will partner
our parents to stand united in supporting and guiding our students through
this journey. Let us offer our encouragement and affirmation to our students,
emphasising the importance of their best efforts and celebrating their
achievements, regardless of the assessment outcomes. All the best to our
Primary 6 Fairsians sitting for the PSLE, we are cheering for you and praying
for you!</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued understanding and support as we work
together to nurture and empower our students.</p>
<p>Serving with you,
<br><strong>Mrs Soh Mei Foong</strong>
<br>Principal</p>
