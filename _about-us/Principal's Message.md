<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>As we conclude Term 3 and welcome Term 4, I am delighted to share with
you the remarkable journey our students have embarked on this term.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrating Term 3 Achievements</strong>
<br>Term 3 has been truly event-packed, with our students demonstrating outstanding
achievements across diverse areas. From co-curricular activities (CCA)
spanning various categories—the arts, NSG (National School Games), uniformed
groups, to songwriting and various students’ performances at school events—our
Fairsians have showcased competencies that extend far beyond technical
skills. They have embodied diligence, resilience, creativity, and teamwork
in everything they do.</p>
<p>However, what fills me with the greatest pride is witnessing our students
demonstrate kindness and love through their service to the community and
God. Through our Makers and Sustainability programme, we have nurtured
in them the importance of caring for our earth and practising sustainable
living. Our students have enthusiastically participated in Makers@Heart
recess programmes, breathing new life into recycled items while exercising
their creativity.</p>
<p>In celebration of Founder's Day, our students, with tremendous support
from parents, contributed generously through our OAKS (Our Acts of Kindness
and Service) programme. This year, we extended our giving beyond our support
staff to include migrant workers through ItsRainingRaincoats. It was truly
heartwarming to witness our students expressing appreciation not only through
physical gifts but also through heartfelt messages they penned themselves.
Indeed, our students have beautifully exemplified our 2025 theme: ‘Love
is in the Sunshine’!</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude to Our Parents-in-Education</strong>
<br>The enriching activities and programmes that have taken our students beyond
classroom walls this term would not have been possible without the unwavering
support of our Partners-in-Education (PiE). From diverse recess programmes
to learning journeys outside school, your generous contribution of time
and effort has truly enriched the school experience for all Fairsians.
Some of our PiE dedicate so much time to supporting us that it resembles
full-time work! A special mention goes to the group of PiE who set up an
alfresco-style café one morning to prepare breakfast for our staff in celebration
of Teachers’ Day. Thank you for making our teachers feel genuinely loved
and valued.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead to Term 4</strong>
<br>As we enter Term 4, the final term of the school year, our focus will
shift to supporting our students through various academic assessments,
including the PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination) for our graduating
cohort. During this period, we must be mindful not to add unnecessary stress
through unrealistic expectations. Instead, we recognise that each and every
child is ‘a gift from God’—unique, with individual needs and aspirations.
We will love and support them with this understanding at heart.</p>
<p>Whilst we provide our unwavering support, we also recognise the importance
of helping our children take ownership of their learning and achievements.
As we embrace the challenges that Term 4 assessments will bring, we hold
fast to the assurance that God's grace will be sufficient for our children
and for us as we journey alongside them.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah 29:11</strong> - <em>"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, to give you hope and a future."</em>
</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued partnership in nurturing our students' growth
and development.</p>
<p>Serving with you,
<br><strong>Mrs Soh Mei Foong</strong>
<br>Principal</p>
