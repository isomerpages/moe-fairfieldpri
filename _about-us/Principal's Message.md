<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
We are thankful that our 135th *Oh!It’sFairfield!* Carnival held on 29 Apr 2023 (Sat) was an overwhelming success. We saw multitudes of Fairsians, both past and present, turning up in the schools to participate in our celebratory event with food, entertainment, bonding, and fun! I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all parents for your support in various ways, whether it was through sponsoring and donating goods, helping out at the stalls, or purchasing tickets and being present with your children during this highly memorable Fairsian experience. As the carnival also serves as a fundraising event for school improvement and development, I am very grateful to all our supporters for helping both Fairfield Schools achieve our fundraising targets. Fairfield has truly been blessed by God’s provision, and we testify to His goodness and love for our school. With much given, much is expected. The school will continue to upgrade and improve our facilities to ensure that present and future generations of Fairsians enjoy excellent school amenities to enhance their learning experience.&nbsp;

Term 3 promises to be another exciting term for our students as we eagerly anticipate our very own production _Fairfield! The Musical_ that will be held at the Victoria Theatre on 28 and 29 Jul 2023 (Fri &amp; Sat). We encourage you to purchase tickets and attend the musical to support our talented performers and make it a memorable family outing.

On 4 Aug 2023 (Fri), we commemorate Founder’s Day with a combined service for both schools. On this day, we will come together as one to worship God and celebrate His blessings upon Fairfield over the last 135 years. I humbly ask that you keep the school in your prayers as we strive to continually enrich students’ learning and development each year.

To God be the Glory!

In partnership with you,  <br>
