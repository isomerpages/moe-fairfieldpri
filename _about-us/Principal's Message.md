<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>Term 2 has been a vibrant celebration of learning, growth, and community
spirit at Fairfield. From our Arts Excite! concert showcasing our students'
artistic talents, to the meaningful celebration of International Friendship
Day, and the engaging Mother Tongue Language Fortnight activities, our
students have embraced diverse opportunities to develop both their competencies
and character. I am particularly heartened to see our students demonstrating
resilience, creativity, and teamwork across these various platforms.</p>
<p>Our 2025 theme ‘Love is in the Sunshine’ has truly come alive through
the generous spirit of our Fairfield community. The overwhelming response
to both the Methodist Welfare Services Hong Bao Donation Drive, where we
contributed 15% of the national collection, and the Methodist Walk, where
we exceeded our fundraising target, reflects our community's deep commitment
to serving others. These achievements are more than just numbers – they
are powerful learning moments that help our students understand the importance
of empathy and social responsibility. I am especially proud of how our
Primary 4 students represented our school at the Methodist Walk, displaying
exemplary behaviour and supporting one another throughout the journey.</p>
<p>As we continue to focus on building a positive school tone this year,
I am encouraged to see our students increasingly embracing values of respect,
integrity, and empathy in their daily interactions. Whether it's through
their participation in Earth Week activities, demonstrating cyber wellness
awareness, or supporting their peers during various school events, our
students are learning that true excellence encompasses both academic achievement
and character development.</p>
<p>As we journey into Term 3, we seek to further strengthen our partnership
with parents in nurturing our students' character and social-emotional
development. A positive school tone is built on daily choices and interactions,
and every member of our community plays a vital role. We encourage parents
to engage in regular conversations with your children about showing kindness,
managing emotions well, and making responsible choices. When our students
see these values modelled consistently both at home and in school, they
are better equipped to develop into resilient individuals who can relate
well to others and contribute positively to the community. Together, we
can create an environment where every Fairsian feels safe, respected, and
empowered to be their best self.</p>
<p>I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to our dedicated teachers
who have worked tirelessly to design and deliver enriching learning experiences,
and to our parent community for your unwavering support in nurturing our
students to be future-ready individuals who serve God and the community
with purpose and joy.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;“Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.”&nbsp; 1 Thessalonians 5:11</em>

<p>Serving with you,
<br><strong>Mrs Soh Mei Foong</strong>
<br>Principal</p>
