<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
As we get ready to welcome Term 2, we have much to be thankful for in the one term that has just passed.

Our young ones are blessed with the dare to take on the many demands of a dynamic world. They know that school is where you cultivate more than knowledge and life-long skills. They are increasingly aware that school is about character building, about raising citizens and leaders who can ‘walk on stormy seas’. As we resume face-to-face activities, they have responded with enthusiasm and excitement. For them, learning is joy unsurpassed.  

At Fairfield, we appreciate that every student is unique. We are committed to help the child explore, discover and realise his/her potential and the gifts bestowed by God. In early February at the P5 Cohort Camp, we witness how the P5 students demonstrated not just the spirit of perseverance but also the willingness to take on every challenge, however daunting. Many learn to overcome their fears and limitations given a very different kind of learning environment. In the process, they even extended their learning to help and encourage their peers as well. Also, at our National School Games, our sports teams displayed much grit, teamwork and the spirit of excellence as they played against different school teams. Whatever scores they achieve at the end of each game, it’s always a ‘good game’ to them because they have enjoyed the moment and strived to give their best. 

Indeed, our staff and parents are dedicated to the cause of promoting excellence at school in Fairfield. Thank you all for your relentless support and contribution in Term 1. You are the reason we are Flourishing as One Fairfield. I am constantly reminded and inspired by Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”

To God be the Glory!

In partnership with you,  <br>
