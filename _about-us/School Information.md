<p>The emblem of the heart which forms the central motif of the school crest represents the highest of all emotions Love - the love of God for Man and the love of Man for his neighbour.</p>
<p>When the heart is Pure and Honest, the Holy Spirit can dwell within and transform the nature of the individual, ennobling it and refining it.</p>
<p>Summounting the heart is the torch of Knowledge and Wisdom which can illuminate the mind and broaden the vision of all who seek its light. Emblazoned in a band of burnished gold across the emblem of the heart are the initials of the school; it represents the Loyalty for the Alma Mater. The two stars that are at the base of the crest reflect the school motto, PURE &amp; HONEST, ideals which every student should aspire to attain.</p>
