<h4><strong>Aesthetics</strong></h4>
<p>Aesthetics Day is a special day set aside for all pupils from Primary 1 to 6 to perform on a 360-degree stage. Organised by the Aesthetics department, the event aims to nurture confident Fairsians who are appreciative of the arts. On that day, students&rsquo; musical talents are showcased through various performances based on the music curriculum (e.g. ukulele, ethnic drums, keyboard, song and dance). It is a fun occasion where everybody takes turn to perform as well as be a supportive and appreciative audience.</p>

<p><u>Verse 1<br /></u>Sitting on my swing,<br />Swinging to the sky,<br />Looking at the city thinking what it used to be.<br />Back and forth the swing,<br />Then and now the scenes,<br />200 years, 54 years where do I begin?</p>
<p><u>Pre-chorus<br /></u>Then we built sandcastles in the playground, sat on the see-saw with friends.&nbsp;<br />Now our parents sit around and wait for our playtime to end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Chorus<br /></u>Past and present, many faces, we are Singapore.<br />Streets and houses may be different, we are still one people.&nbsp;<br />Hopscotch, five-stones, pick-up-sticks or with the new iPad.<br />Fun and games we shared,<br />In a place that is home,<br />This is where I call my Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Outro<br /></u>Wherever you may go,<br />There is no place like home,<br />This is where I call my Singapore.</p>

<h4><strong>130th Founder&rsquo;s Day Theme Song Writing Masterclass and Mentoring Session</strong></h4>
<p>To allow our students an opportunity to learn more about songwriting and appreciate works from local composers, we engaged a professional from the creative industry and ex-Fairsian, Ms Elaine Chan. She mentored the student songwriters who composed the winning theme song and guided them on how to enhance it. She also conducted a masterclass for all interested students and shared tips on songwriting. The students also had a fun time singing famous NDP tunes composed by Ms Chan such as NDP 2005 theme song &ldquo;Reach out for the skies&rdquo; and NDP 2013 theme song &ldquo;One Singapore&rdquo;. Students even had a chance to co-create a song together with her! What a musical treat it was for our Fairsians! The masterclass was held on 3 July 2018 at the FMS(P) Performing Arts Studio (PAS).</p>
