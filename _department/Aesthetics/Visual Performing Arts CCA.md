<h4><strong>Chinese Dance</strong></h4>
<p>With the experience and dedication of the dance instructors, the students not only learn about the culture of dance, they also develop leadership skills and acquire positive values like perseverance, self-discipline and commitment. This year, 2018, the team attained the prestigious Distinction Award at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) presentation. They were also invited to perform at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre during the SYF celebrations. The dancers continue to seek greater challenges through outdoor performances and other learning opportunities.</p>

<h4><strong>Handbell Ensemble</strong></h4>
<p>The FMS(P) Handbell Ensemble was formed in 2009. The team comprises members from Primary Two to Primary Six. The team is led by our Instructor, Mr Damien Lim. During training, the members not only learn the skills of handling and ringing the bells, they also learn to be responsible team players. So far, the Handbell Ensemble has showcased their talent at the SYF Arts Presentation 2018, Fairfield&rsquo;s Night of STARs and Founder&rsquo;s Day Service.</p>

<h4><strong>Choir</strong></h4>
<p>Our choir is made up of passionate girls and boys who simply delight in singing. With the dedicated devotion and commitment of our Choral Instructor, Ms Susanna Pua and our choir teachers, the choir has been exposed to several performing platforms and has consistently achieved the Certificate of Distinction for the past 3 SYFs.</p>
<p>Fairfield Methodist School (Primary) choir is designed to enhance the musical, creative and expressive qualities of our members&rsquo; voices. It comprises of the Junior Choir (P2 &amp; P3) and the Senior Choir (P4 to P6). Our choir has been very active this year. It performed in various platforms such as SYF Arts Presentation 2018, Night of STARs, combined choir exchange at School Of The Arts (SOTA), performance at National Art Gallery and combined choir performances with Grace Orchard School and was a guest choir at Raffles Girls School&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Cantare V: The Visitor&rdquo;. Through the choir practices, students learn to apply musical skills to create and experience music as an ensemble.</p>
