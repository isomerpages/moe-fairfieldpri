<h4><strong>General Art Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Through a purposeful and well-designed art curriculum, we hope to develop students who are confident, imaginative and inquisitive. Our six-year programme is based on the theme of Singapore and the World with the objective to foster a sense of respect for Singapore&rsquo;s diverse cultures and awareness of local history.</p>
<img style="width: 75%;" src="/images/art1.jpg" />
<p>Based on a belief that art has a vital role in the world (see figure above), our art education framework aims to infuse the values of art through an&nbsp;<strong>Expose, Enable and Excel</strong>&nbsp;(see figure above) approach. This framework allows our teachers to maximize the learning platforms for different mediums, various important artists, and selected famous artworks for all students; and further nurture and develop students who display a propensity for making art.</p>
<p>Our basic philosophy on art education is: ignite students&rsquo; passion for the subject through a&nbsp;<strong>participative and appreciative</strong>&nbsp;platform so as to mirror the practice of art making in the real world. Students are therefore encouraged to share and exhibit ideas and creations and at the same time learn and appreciate other people&rsquo;s ideas and creations.</p>
<h4><strong>VISUAL ART PROGRAMME &amp; ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2021</strong></h4>
<p><strong>FAIRFIELD PAINTS ITS VISION OF FUTURE HOUSING<br /></strong>To allow our students to envision their future housing and living, our P6 students were involved in a community Art Project in collaboration with Housing Development Board (HDB). Their artworks captured their aspirations in both paint and digital art mediums. Our students&rsquo; artworks will be showcased in May during the HDB Community Week 2021 &ndash; an exhibition curated by local artist, Mr Sun Yu-li. These exhibited artworks will inspire the planning and design of future HDB towns, neighbourhoods and flats.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SYF 2019 SPECIAL PROJECT: OUR INCLUSIVE ART CLASSROOM<br /></strong>As part of the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) @ FMS(P) - entitled HeARTS, with focus on developing empathy and building social awareness through the arts, the visual art team embarked on a research study project aimed to understand the meaning of inclusivity in a classroom, and how students from mainstream and SPED schools interact and collaborate through art.</p>
<p>This project was done over 5 months in Semester 1 (January &ndash; May 2019), and was facilitated by our art teacher, Mr Wong Yek Yue.</p>
<p>Through our students' verbal and written reflections and teachers' observations, we saw our students' growth in terms of having a positive growth mindset- understanding that people come from diverse profiles and cultures, accepting others and worked with their buddies from Grace Orchard School to co-create art for SYF 2019 Art Exhibition.</p>
