STEM CLUB
---------

The newly set up STEM Club aims to promote students’ interest in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics domains through modules such as coding, 3D printing, robotics and film-making just to name a few. 

  

Besides technical skills, STEM education builds and encourages problem solving skills. In the STEM club, students learn how to analyze problems and then work to correct and overcome them through design thinking.
