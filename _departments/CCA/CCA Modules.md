CCA Modules provide students with opportunities to explore and deepen their interests through a wide range of knowledge-based and skills-based activities conducted throughout the year. These modules are guided by the LEAPS framework, which encompasses four key domains: Enrichment, Physical, Aesthetics, and Leadership & Service.

By participating in diverse modules across these domains, students are developed holisticallyâ€”building a strong foundation for lifelong learning and personal growth.
