<h4><strong>STEM Club</strong></h4>

The newly set up STEM Club aims to promote students’ interest in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics domains through modules such as coding, 3D printing, robotics and film-making just to name a few.&nbsp;

Besides technical skills, STEM education builds and encourages problem solving skills. In the STEM club, students learn how to analyze problems and then work to correct and overcome them through design thinking.

<h4><strong>Vine Kids
</strong></h4>

<p>Vine Kids aims to provide a nurturing and inspiring environment, where God’s Word is taught in creative, stimulating and relevant ways. We do this through stories from the Bible, testimonies of missionaries and illustrations from everyday life. Through stories we hope to reflect and learn important truths from God’s Word and through application grow in godly character. There will also be a time of praise and worship, interactive games, discussion, and creative activities to do.</p></section>

<p>Through our learning together, our students will grow in knowing the love and goodness of God, grow in confidence as children of God, learn to serve and care for one another.</p>
