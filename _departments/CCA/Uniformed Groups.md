<h4><strong>Boys' Brigade</strong></h4>
The 33J Boys’ Brigade Singapore Company is one of the largest Junior Programme companies in Singapore. Across the 4 year programme, our Boys develop as servant leaders with character and compassion: caring and confident; resilient and responsible; thankful and truthful; and disciplined and driven — in word, thought and deed.

The programme cultivates the fruits of goodness and faithfulness in every Boy, to emerge as leaders in their own right. By building their individual capacities through personal mastery modules to communicate and collaborate with their peers, our Primary 3 and 4 grow Spiritually, Physically, Mentally and Emotionally. Our Primary 5 and 6 students take the helm alongside their teachers, seniors and officers to collaboratively cultivate the spirit of unity within Uniformed Groups in Fairfield. These experiences include our Annual Camps, P6 Graduation and Community Outreach events.

We partner with a multitude of stakeholders to be first for Boys. Join us to build the character and confidence of your child.

<h4><strong>Girls' Brigade</strong></h4>
<p>At Girls’ Brigade in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Primary Company, girls aged 9-12 years old will spend time having much fun and learning new skills, attitudes and knowledge through activity-based programmes. A GB girl will go through the S.T.A. R. (<strong>S</strong>ervice,&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>reasure,&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>dventure and&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>esponsibility) badgework programme and learn about her own strengths and weaknesses yet be empowered to help others through words and actions and will also be given opportunities to take on new and unknown challenges. For example, a GB Girl can attain the Creator, Artiste, Professional and Handy Girl Adventure badges over her 4 years in GB.</p></section>
<p>Our teachers and officers create platforms where our well-crafted syllabus encourages the girls to explore the world around them and have a sense of discipline while cultivating a heart of service through practical workshops, learning journeys, camps, drill sessions and a variety of activities. GB girls will be given many opportunities in their leadership journey as GB Singapore is committed to developing every Girl into a leader. We hope each girl will leave GB having learnt the values of Reverence, Respect and Responsibility.</p>
