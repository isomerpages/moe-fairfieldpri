<h4><strong>Reward &amp; Recognition System</strong></h4>
<p>Character development is of utmost importance in Fairfield. The Reward and Recognition (R &amp; R) system serves as a platform to encourage students to display the school core values. Students are given R&amp;R stamps for displaying these values. These stamps can be exchanged for tokens such as bookmarks and collar pins when the child reaches a certain milestone.</p>
