<h4><strong>Oracy Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Fairfield&rsquo;s Oracy Programme empowers Fairsians to become confident communicators who are able to express themselves clearly, effectively and persuasively. This is achieved through our carefully designed age-appropriate activities that aim to excite Fairsians and ignite their imagination and creativity as they express themselves in different contexts. The Oracy programme runs alongside MOE&rsquo;s core English Curriculum, STELLAR 2.0, and includes self-directed activities like Poetry Appreciation and collaborative ones like Radio Podcast and the Hosting of Kindergarteners. Through the Programme, Fairsians also gain essential IT literacy skills as they have opportunities to co-create podcasts using Google Docs, Microsoft Teams and Word. In these ways, Fairsians gain 21st Century Skills that will keep them ready for the changing landscapes of their generation.</p>
<h4><strong>Fairfield wRiters and Ambassadors Programme (FRAP)</strong></h4>
<p>FRAP is an extension of the ALP and is designed to stretch Fairsians who have shown an aptitude and interest in writing and presenting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our wRiters are challenged with writing projects that push them to explore new writing techniques and genres. In the process, they develop their own voice as writers. Their works are featured in the Department&rsquo;s publication, &ldquo;BOOKed!&rsquo;. A milestone project that the wRiters have been working on is the trilogy Anniversary Collection - Book 1 &ldquo;A World has opened for Us&rdquo;, a collection of poems, and Book 2 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s at Fairfield, at Fairfield!&rdquo; which is compilation of our wRiters&rsquo; works from their first foray into comic book writing and illustration. Book 3 will be released in 2023, our 135th anniversary.</p>
<p>Our Ambassadors attend workshops that have been curated to give them the skills to present to a large audience. They are the faces at school events where they confidently act as guides to share about our school history and programmes to guests. They also put together videos that share their opinions on age appropriate matters - from book reviews and recommendations to advocacy issues that are close to their hearts.</p>
