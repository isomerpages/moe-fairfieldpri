<h1><strong>Digital Literacy Programme</strong></h1>
<p>In our rapidly evolving digital world, it's more important than ever for
our students to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate technology
safely and effectively. That's why Fairfield has developed our Digital
Literacy Programme, designed to empower our students with essential digital
competencies. The strengthening of students’ digital literacy and technological
skills is also one of the key strategic thrusts in the MOE EdTech Masterplan
2030.</p>
<p><strong>Programme Overview</strong> 
<br>Our existing Digital Literacy Programme was updated in 2023, starting
with our enthusiastic Primary 1 students and has since expanded to other
levels. The programme complements the existing use of tech-enabled teaching
and learning in our classrooms. When students go through the updated Digital
Literacy Programme, they will be exposed to all 9 digital competencies
under MOE’s digital literacy framework through the 6 years in Fairfield.
This will ensure that every student benefits from a solid foundation in
digital literacy.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Platform</strong> 
<br>The digital literacy modules are mainly assigned within the SLS (Student
Learning Space) portal, where students can learn at their own pace, anytime
and anywhere. These modules are thoughtfully designed to adopt a spiral
approach, gradually building on technological skills and new media literacies.
This method ensures that learning is progressive, with each level delving
deeper into the digital world.</p>

<p><strong>Programme Highlights</strong> 
<br>- <strong>Technological Skills:</strong> Students will learn essential technical
skills through modules such as touch typing, using a web browser, taking
screenshots, and understanding the basic functions of Microsoft Office
applications.</p>
<p>- <strong>New Media Literacies:</strong> In today's digital age, understanding
the implications of our online actions is crucial. Our modules on cyber
etiquette, digital footprints, copyright awareness, and managing personal
information aim to cultivate responsible digital citizens.</p>

<p><strong>Recognition and Achievement</strong> 
<br>We believe in celebrating our students' achievements. Upon completing
all modules for their year group, students will be awarded a unique badge
for their level. These badges not only recognize their hard work and dedication
but also encourage a sense of pride in their digital literacy accomplishments.</p>
