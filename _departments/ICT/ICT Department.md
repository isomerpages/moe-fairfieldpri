<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Connected learners and learning leaders for the 21st Century. In FMS(P), we strive to enrich all Fairsians’ learning and enhance collaboration with meaningful connected learning through an ICT-enriched learning environment. We aim to develop every Fairsian, a 21st century learner, ethical digital user who is competent in New Media Literacies to navigate the cyber world safely and effectively.</p>
<h4><strong>Programme and Highlights</strong></h4>
<p>The school adopts an Educational Technology integration plan which integrates technology in learning across various subjects to achieve the baseline standards as well as develop New Media Literacies. Students would be on Fairfield’s customised 6 year Digital Literacy Programme so they will be able to acquire digital skills across four components in the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework from MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme to be developed as an ethical digital user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our ICT-enriched learning environment, our school had created our own Virtual campus with Microsoft Teams as a one-stop platform to support FMS(P)’s customised Digital Literacy Program that aligns New Media Literacy (NML) skills and cyber wellness (CW), allowing students to practise CW skills as they equip themselves with new digital literacy in curriculum. As part of our Virtual Campus, our students will get the opportunity to have access to devices in the classrooms to support student-centric learning experiences with technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school library aims to provide a conducive environment to excite and promote reading. Thematic displays and recommended books are refreshed frequently to interest students in different genres of books. Library includes a digital space for students to support our students’ learning with access to electronic resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within library contains our Makerspace as part of our exciting Makerspace curriculum that aims to develop students in Design thinking which involves critical and creative problem-solving skills, equipping our students with future-ready skills.</p>
