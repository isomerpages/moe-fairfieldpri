<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every Fairsian a passionate learner and a determined problem solver.</p>
<p>At FMS(P), we focus on developing students’ problem solving skills in a fun and meaningful way. The department programmes follow closely to the direction set by MOE. The programmes enable students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics</li>
<li>develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving;</li>
<li>build confidence and foster interest in mathematics</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Programme and Highlights</strong></h4>
<p>Every Fairsian, from Primary 1 to 6, is engaged in the learning of Mathematics through a myriad of hands-on activities and real-life problem-solving scenarios. Learning experiences play a pivotal role in the learning of Mathematics across all the levels in Fairfield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The younger students are engaged in fun math activities, discovering the joy of learning in their formative years. Students are introduced to the family of numbers in a progressive manner. They have the opportunity to use play money in counting amounts of money in dollars and cents. They also get to mimic real-life scenarios such as cake-cutting to concretise their understanding of unit and like fractions.</p>
<p>Students also have fun putting their measurement skills into practice. They were assigned tasks such as measuring the volumes of liquids, the masses of everyday items and the height of a door signage. With the help of different measuring instruments, the students in their groups had to make a collective decision on the most appropriate measuring instrument and methodology to complete their tasks. They even leveraged ICT technology such as augmented reality to help them in their measurement tasks.</p>
<p>Our students also explored the application of Mathematics outside the classroom context – on a Shopping Trail to the supermarket – on a Shopping Trail to the supermarket – while building empathy at the same time. With a purpose to bless our less-privileged elderly folks at Lions Befrienders, our students worked in groups to draw up a shopping list of daily necessities such as food and drinks. With a sum of money, students learnt how to do up a simple budget, taking into consideration the nutritional values of the items to be bought for our elderly folks. Students have to problem-solve on the spot if the items they have budgeted become unavailable. The students also understood better the needs of the elderly and mobility-challenged residents when they witnessed how the customised designs in the supermarket serve the residents better.</p>
