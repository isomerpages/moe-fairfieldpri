<h4><strong>PE</strong></h4>

In Fairfield, we believe in providing students with a holistic and experiential learning through our 6 years PE and Outdoor Experential Program. These experiences to “Master Self” inculcates in students a spirit of excellence and the ability to think critically and creatively.

  

Through the different Outdoor Experiential activities, students are taught to communicate skilfully as they relate well to others.

<h4><strong>P4 to P6 Sports Carnival
</strong></h4>

With the purpose of engaging students in physical activities, the PE department organised a Sports Carnival annually for every student from Primary 4 to 6 to participate. This provides an opportunity for students to make use of the skills learnt during PE lessons and strengthen the values acquired in a fun-filled friendly competition. 

  
Students are grouped into sports or non-sports team players and they represent their houses to compete against each other in the assigned games to gain points for their houses. This friendly competitive environment helps to promote teamwork, camaraderie and foster a sense of belonging.
