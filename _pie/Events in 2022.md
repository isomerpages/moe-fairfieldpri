## Events in 2022


### P1 Shepherding / P1 Parents Welcome Tea (4 January 2022)


PiE parents were all ready to extend a warm welcome to the new P1s and their parents into the Fairfield Family. Over the first three days of school, PiE parents shepherded the P1s and helped them settle in. This helped allay the anxieties of the new pupils and their parents. On the first day, P1 parents were also initiated into primary school life and the Fairfield culture with a Parenting Talk. This was followed by networking among the parents by their respective classes.
