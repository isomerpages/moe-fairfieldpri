<p><strong>P1 Shepherding / P1 Parents Welcome Tea (03, 06 and 07 January 2025)</strong>
</p>
<p>PiE parents were all ready to extend a warm welcome to the new P1s and
their parents into the Fairfield Family. Over the first three days of school,
PiE parents shepherded the P1s and helped them settle in. This helped allay
the anxieties of the new pupils and their parents. On the first day, P1
parents were also initiated into primary school life and the Fairfield
culture with a Parenting Talk. This was followed by networking among the
parents by their respective classes.</p>
