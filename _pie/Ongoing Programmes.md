<p><strong>Reading Support (Ongoing)<br /></strong>A group of 20 parents support this meaningful programme. For the entire year, they come in twice a week, 7am &ndash; 7:30am, to read with selected pupils. In an informal and fun setting, the pupils enjoy being guided by a supportive adult in their reading journey. This is fulfilling for both parents and pupils as strong bonds are fostered.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Programme<br /></strong>Supportive parents are instrumental in nurturing the readers of the next generation. Once a week, PiE parents conduct storytelling during recess time. Through the PiE parents&rsquo; engaging and interactive storytelling, the characters of the stories come to live and students are mesmerized and transported into a world of fairytales and fiction. This has helped to instill the love of reading in our students.&nbsp;</p>
