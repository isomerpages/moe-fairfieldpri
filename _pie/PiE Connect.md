<p>PiE parents work hard and play even harder! While we chip in to make school
life even more enriching for the children of FMSP, we also take care of
ourselves. The PiE Engagement Committee, officially formed in 2016, facilitates
new friendships and bonding among PiE parents over fun activities.</p>
<p>All FMSP parents and caregivers are welcome to join us at these activities.
Have an idea for group activities? Speak to the committee and see your
ideas come to life!&nbsp;</p>
