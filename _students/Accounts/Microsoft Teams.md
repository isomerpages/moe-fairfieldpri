<p>Microsoft Teams is part of the Microsoft Office Suite and is used by the
school as a central online platform for learning and communication. It
serves as your virtual classroom, where you can stay updated with announcements
from your teachers, participate in discussions, ask questions, and submit
your assignments — all in one place.</p>
<p>Some Home-Based Learning lessons or consultations/remedials may be conducted
on Teams. Your teacher will inform you if there are such lessons. Your
CCA and small-group (e.g. student leaders) will also have a Teams page
for your teachers to communicate with you. Teams is also used for e-Meet
the Parent sessions — during these, your parents can log in using your
account to speak with your teachers.</p>
<p>You can access Teams through a web browser at this link <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/</a> or
by downloading the app.</p>
<p><strong>Username and password</strong>
</p>
<p>Please refer to your <u>student handbook</u> for your username and password.</p>
<p>You may refer to the guide below to reset your password. Students are
encouraged to set their own alternative email address to reset passwords
with parents.</p>

<p>If the self-reset doesn’t work, you can contact your Form Teacher for
help.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>Your Teams account also gives you access to Microsoft Office 365 (O365)
tools like Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and more. You can even download Microsoft
Office on up to four devices (including your phone or computer), so you
can work from wherever is most convenient.</p>
